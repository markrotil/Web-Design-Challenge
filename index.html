            <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator
                To accomplish the analysis, we first pulled data from OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on
                over 500 cities.

                After assembling the dataset. we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude.
                Factors we looked at included:
                temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations
                created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations
                witnessed.
